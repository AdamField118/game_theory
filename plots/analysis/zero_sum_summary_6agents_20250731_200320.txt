ZERO-SUM EVOLUTIONARY GAME SIMULATION SUMMARY
============================================

System Configuration:
- Game type: Zero-Sum Rock-Paper-Scissors
- Selection method: Deterministic (argmax)
- Vertices: 6
- Time steps: 10
- Initial pattern: striped
- Initial bank value: -1000.0
- Random seed: 42

Zero-Sum Properties:
- Payoff matrix: Winner +1, Loser -1, Tie 0
- Total system wealth: -6000.0 (constant)
- Wealth conservation: True
- Max wealth deviation: 0.00e+00
- Expected dynamics: Deterministic spatial patterns

Initial Pattern Analysis:
- Pattern type: striped
- Initial wealth std: 0.00
- Initial communities: 3
- Largest initial community: 2

Final State Analysis:
- Rock (0): 2 agents (33.3%)
- Paper (1): 2 agents (33.3%)
- Scissors (2): 2 agents (33.3%)

Diversity Evolution:
- Initial Shannon diversity: 1.099
- Final Shannon diversity: 1.099
- Diversity change: +0.000

Community Structure Evolution:
Initial State:
- Number of communities: 3
- Average community size: 2.0 (std: 0.0) if initial_communities else (0, 0)
- Largest community: 2

Final State:
- Number of communities: 3
- Average community size: 2.0 (std: 0.0) if final_communities else (0, 0)
- Largest community: 2

Wealth Redistribution:
- Initial wealth mean: -1000.00 ± 0.00
- Final wealth mean: -1000.00 ± 1.00
- Wealth redistribution: +1.00 (change in std)
- Wealth range: [-1001.0, -999.0]

Zero-Sum Validation:
- Total wealth conserved: True
- Expected total: -6000
- Actual final total: -6000
- Conservation error: 0.00e+00
