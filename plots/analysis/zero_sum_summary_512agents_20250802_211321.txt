Community Structure Evolution:
Initial State:
- Number of communities: 3
- Average community size: 170.7 (std: 0.9) if initial_communities else (0, 0)
- Largest community: 172

Final State:
- Number of communities: 3
- Average community size: 170.7 (std: 92.7) if final_communities else (0, 0)
- Largest community: 284

Wealth Redistribution:
- Initial wealth mean: -1000.00 ± 0.00
- Final wealth mean: -1000.00 ± 0.17
- Wealth redistribution: +0.17 (change in std)
- Wealth range: [-1001.0, -998.0]

Zero-Sum Validation:
- Total wealth conserved: True
- Expected total: -512000
