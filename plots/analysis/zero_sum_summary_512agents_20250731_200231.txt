- Final Shannon diversity: 0.662
- Diversity change: -0.436

Community Structure Evolution:
Initial State:
- Number of communities: 3
- Average community size: 170.7 (std: 0.9) if initial_communities else (0, 0)
- Largest community: 172

Final State:
- Number of communities: 3
- Average community size: 170.7 (std: 137.2) if final_communities else (0, 0)
- Largest community: 338

Wealth Redistribution:
- Initial wealth mean: -1000.00 ± 0.00
- Final wealth mean: -1000.00 ± 2.15
- Wealth redistribution: +2.15 (change in std)
- Wealth range: [-1024.0, -975.0]

Zero-Sum Validation:
- Total wealth conserved: True
- Expected total: -512000
- Actual final total: -512000
- Conservation error: 0.00e+00
